## 🤔 What is a REST API?

A **REST API** allows a **Client** (e.g., laptop, browser, phone) to communicate with a **Server**.

| Client | → Sends Request | Server | → Sends Response |
|-------|----------------|--------|------------------|
| Laptop / Phone | GET `/some-data` | Go Backend | JSON Data |
| (or) | POST `/some-data` | | Success / Error |

### Key Concepts:
- Data is usually exchanged in **JSON** format.
- Each operation is defined by an **HTTP Method + URL Endpoint**  
  (e.g., `GET /products` or `POST /login`)
